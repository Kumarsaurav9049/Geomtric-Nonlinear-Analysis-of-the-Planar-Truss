**Acknowledgments:** 
I am thankful to Dr. Vaibhav Singhal, Associate Professor in the Structural Engineering Department at the Indian Institute of Technology Patna, for his immense motivation in writing the fully automated, generalized code for the analysis of 2D trusses.

 **Verification of the Code:**
The code is validated using the question written in the book Fundamentals of the Finite Elements, Written by David Hutton. Example No. 3.2 of this book is used.
**Question Details:**
The two-element truss shown in the figure is subjected to external loading, as shown. Using the same node and element numbering as in Figure, determine the displacement components of node 3, the reaction force components at nodes 1 and 2, and the element displacements, stresses, and forces. The elements have a modulus of elasticity of 𝐸_1 = 𝐸_2 = 10 ∗ 10^6 𝑙𝑏/𝑖𝑛^2 and cross-sectional areas of 𝐴_1 = 𝐴_2 = 1.5 𝑖𝑛^2.
 
• For running this code Just Run the main File named as“Static Analysis of 2d Truss
 run this file”.
 • Put all function file in the current Directory of the MATLAB
 • You need to answer some questions that are :
 1. Enter the type of the element which you want to analyse:-(enter in lower case
 letter)
 linear or nonlinear
